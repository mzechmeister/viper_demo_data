# viper_demo_data

Two sets of demo data are available. One is for the TLS instrument (TCES), reperesent data reduction of optical data, the other is for the CRIRES+ instrument, representing data in the NIR.

1) CRIRES+ \
A set of demo data is given for the star GJ588 from a single setting (K2192) in /data/CRIRES, including
following files: \
• combined nodding spectra with cell (in /data/CRIRES/GJ588/withSGC/) \
• combined nodding spectra without cell (in /data/CRIRES/GJ588/noSGC/) \
• telluric-free template (/data/CRIRES/GJ588/test/GJ588_test_tpl.fits)

The data were reduced using V1.3.0 of the DRS CR2RES pipeline.

3) TCES/TLS \
A set of demo data is given for the star HD189733 is stored in /data/TLS, including following files: \
• spectra with cell (in /data/TLS/HD189733/) \
• template spectrum without cell (/data/TLS/HD189733_tpl/HD189733.model) \
• HARPS template (/data/TLS/HD189733_tpl/HARPS*.fits) \
